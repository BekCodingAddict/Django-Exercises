Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites and applications. It takes care of many common web development tasks so developers can focus on the unique parts of their applications. 
## Key Features and Principles
Django follows a "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a comprehensive set of ready-to-use components out of the box. Key features include: 
- Object-Relational Mapper (ORM): This allows you to interact with your database using Python code instead of writing complex SQL queries.
- Automatic Admin Interface: Django dynamically generates a professional, ready-to-use administrative interface based on your data models, which simplifies content management.
- Built-in Authentication: It provides a secure user authentication system to manage user accounts and permissions.
- Security: Django is designed with robust protections against common security threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- URL Routing: It includes a clean system for defining URL patterns and mapping them to the appropriate Python functions (views) in your application.
- Templating Engine: Django's powerful template system allows you to separate the design (HTML) from the code logic, making it easy to generate dynamic content. 
## Architectural Pattern
Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern: 
- Model: Defines the data structure, usually interacting with a database.
- View: The request handler that receives a web request, interacts with the model, and determines what data needs to be sent back.
- Template: A text file (usually HTML) that describes how the data should be presented to the user.
